# MAPPING 2: Race/Ethnicity
# Based on common CSV structure, Group A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4 is a likely simple Label Encoding.

# MAPPING 3: Parental Level of Education
# This mapping is highly speculative without the original encoding table, but we infer based on row 3 having 'associate\'s degree' (CSV) mapped to 0 (Table)
# Let's use a logical order based on complexity/time:
EDU_MAP = {
    "some high school": 5, # High value to avoid clashing with other small integers

LUNCH_MAP = {'free/reduced': 0, 'standard': 1}

# MAPPING 5: Test Preparation Course

# NOTE: This reverse mapping (completed=0, none=1) is unusual but common if encoding was alphabetical (completed < none).
